        <string name="tituloresena">History of Valparaiso</string>
        <string name="inforesena">Valparaíso is the land of General Rafael Uribe Uribe. Your reference
        The best known is the trunk of the old Ceiba tree that for years provided shade to the Main Park.
        Of course, that is not its only attraction, as it has petroglyphs, a cavern, waterfalls and
        many other places of great beauty that are part of the route they propose to tourists.
        This municipality has many recreational farms and in its jurisdiction, although arriving through La
        Pintada, is the imposing Pipintá Canyon, where the best route for practice is
        of the rafting that Antioquia has.</string>
